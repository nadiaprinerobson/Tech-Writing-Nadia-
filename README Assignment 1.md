## Getting Started
1.	Log into your Spredfast account. The button to access your account is located in the upper right-hand portion of the screen. It is very important to ensure that you are logging into the correct section of the website. The direct url for Conversations is https://www.spredfast.com/social-marketing-platform/spredfast-conversations. 
2.	Once logged in, you should be directed to the main screen with the following layout from left to right: My Queue, Primary Collection, To-Do List, Responses, and Closed.
3.	My Queue is the section where you can save items for later or other users on the same account can assign you items. 
4.	The Primary Collection is the space that shows new comments, mentions, messages, and any other information being monitored in the community. Every item that will come through begins in the Primary Collection. From there, you can open the item and move it into your To Do List. 
5.	To open an item and move it into your To Do List, you will need to click on the three little dots on the bottom of the item. There will be a list of options, but you will want to click on Open. Opening an item allows you to label and respond to it. If you open up an item, but did not mean to, you can click on the same three dots and choose the Release option. Releasing an item simply means that you are putting it back into the Primary Collection. 
## Labeling 	
6.	After opening the item, the next step is to label the items. Labeling allows you to know what topics followers are engaging with. 
7.	To label an item, you can click on the icon that look like a label or price tag. The different labels with appear. The different options to label are Sentiment, Topic, Subtopic, Response, and Publisher. 
8.	Determining sentiment is very important when labeling. Sentiment is the reaction behind the post. The options are positive, neutral, and negative. A post with a positive sentiment will be favorable towards the company, while a neutral item will show no bias. Typically news articles and questions that inquire on a topic are neutral. Negative items, everyone’s favorite, say something that is demeaning or harmful on the business. Hopefully, most posts will be positive or neutral. 
9.	Choosing a topic for the item is relatively easy. Most businesses will have a handful of topics that they see people discussing in their communities. For example, a large retailer such as Target might have topics such as customer service, employment opportunities, and inventory concerns. Topics can range based on the company’s presence and the conversation about them online. 
10.	Subtopics, like Topics, can range considering the different factors for a business. Subtopics help you narrow down items into more categories if a Topic is vague. There does not always need to be a subtopic, if the item is too broad to be placed under an even more specific category. For our topic examples with Target, an item could be labeled with a topic like customer service and a subtopic of product return. 
11.	The Actionable label is where you decide whether or not to respond to the item. Responding to comments can vary from liking, sharing, or commenting on the item. If an item needs to be addressed, you can mark it as actionable. Depending on what your company's strategy for managing social media communities, you could have many items that are actionable, or very few. 
12. The Publisher label has users identify who published the item. Monitoring who on the online community is posting certain content helps with further analytics. Examples of Publisher categories can be employees, influencers, trolls, or general followers.

14. Next to the three dots and label icon, there is a conversation bubble icon. Click on the icon and it will lead you to a drop down list with comment, like, share. 
15. Choose with action you would like to initiate for the item. 
16. If you are responding with a comment, it is highly recommended that each company has a guideline book that includes legally approved responses. It is very important that each response is legally approved by the company so there is no chance that using a response from the book will land the business in legal trouble. In the guidelines you can have answers to common questions, comments, and requests. 
17. If you are liking or sharing, you only need to click 'like' or 'share" and the software will automatically do that for you on the platform. To comment, you will click on "comment" where you will type your response and hit publish to make the comment public.
