Pros: I liked this assignment way more than the first one. One thing that I learned was how to navigate and create a WordPress page, which will be very helpful for the future. I felt like the writing part of it was pretty straight forward and simple. I also liked how we got to do some research for content. I felt like there could be more creativitity with this project. 

Cons: One thing I am still unsure of is github pages. Wow, that is super confusing and not worth the 6 extra points. Other than that, there is nothing I really like I didn't learn.
