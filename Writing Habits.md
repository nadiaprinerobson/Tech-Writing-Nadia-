My writing habits consists of trying to get everything done in one sti down session. While looking at my week, I plan out the different times avaible for me to work on assignments and then I plan what I will work in during that time. I will plan to just sit down and complete something in a specific time frame. Typically, this works fairly well. I work on things a lot throughout the day or whenever I have free time. I used to work on it at night, but I also found that my work was not as good as it should be. When working on it in during the day, I am already in that mindset of leanring and working. Once I have initally worked on the project, the times I go back and work on it are to make small adjustments to it. For larger assignments, like in this class, I do break it up into smaller pieces. I set a goal of what I want to complete. For example, I want to write the first two paragrpahs for my paper would be a common goal. 
A few areas that I do need to improve are proofreading and working on it more often. I have a bad habit of just letting spell check do the work for me and not rereading it for mistakes. I also really like the idea of working on it for multiple days. I feel like that would bring in new ideas and new eyes to the paper. Also, I am really bad at keeping away distractions. 
One strength I have is planning out my assignments and work on it during the day when I am most productive.
