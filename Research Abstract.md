Research Abstract

My white paper will be covering the current issue of GMO labeling. My paper will have a persusuve element for being against labeling GMO labeling. However, I will still want to explore both side and break down the history, two sideded arguments, and current policy suggestions. My rearch will themn lead to the conclusion. The call to action will be to think again when taking GMO labeling into consideration. My sources above will help me find the research needed to find the current state and history of GMO labeling policy. I will also be able to find information on the view points of both sides of the argument.
